# Send messages to graylog docker server without TLS for REST #
In order to receive messages from the command line using netcat, you have to create an input stream.
    1. Go to /system/inputs
    2. Create input stream (Raw/Plaintext TCP, port 5555, leave the rest default)
    3. Use the following script to send data to the stream
        while true; do echo "Log message at `date`" | nc localhost 5555; echo "Sent a message on time `date`"; sleep 1; done
    4. You should be able to see data rate increase and incoming messages.

# Enabling TLS for web interface #
    If you want to enable HTTPS for the web interface, you don't have to add your certificate to trusted CAs for JVM.
    Just create the certificate and add the following options to the configuration file.
            web_enable_tls = true
            web_tls_cert_file = /usr/share/graylog/cert.pem
            web_tls_key_file = /usr/share/graylog/pkcs8-plain.pem
    After restarting the server you will be able to go to https:// and add to trusted websites.

# Enabling TLS for REST API #
    http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.1/pages/configuration/https.html#adding-a-self-signed-certificate-to-the-jvm-trust-store
    If you need to enable HTTPS for the REST API, then you have to add your self signed certificate to the JVM cacerts.
    #keytool -importcert -keystore cacerts -alias graylog-self-signed -file /usr/share/graylog/cert.pem
